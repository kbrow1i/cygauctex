The following package has been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* emacs-auctex-11.88-1

AUCTeX is an extensible package for writing and formatting TeX files in GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  It supports many different TeX macro packages, including AMS-TeX, LaTeX, Texinfo, ConTeXt, and DocTeX (dtx files).  AUCTeX includes preview-latex, which makes LaTeX a tightly integrated component of your editing workflow by visualizing selected source chunks (such as single formulas or graphics) directly as images in the source buffer.

This is a new upstream release.  See the release announcement
