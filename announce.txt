The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* emacs-auctex-11.88-2
* preview-latex-11.88-2

AUCTeX is an extensible package for writing and formatting TeX files in GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  It supports many different TeX macro packages, including AMS-TeX, LaTeX, Texinfo, ConTeXt, and DocTeX (dtx files).  AUCTeX includes preview-latex, which makes LaTeX a tightly integrated component of your editing workflow by visualizing selected source chunks (such as single formulas or graphics) directly as images in the source buffer.

This is a repackaging of emacs-auctex-11.88-1 as requested in

  https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-apps/2015-05/msg00066.html .

The only change is that preview-latex has been split off as a separate subpackage that does not require emacs.
