The following package has been updated in the 32-bit Cygwin distribution, and a 64-bit update will follow shortly:

*** emacs-auctex-11.87-2

AUCTeX is an extensible package for writing and formatting TeX files in GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  It supports many different TeX macro packages, including AMS-TeX, LaTeX, Texinfo, ConTeXt, and DocTeX (dtx files). AUCTeX includes preview-latex which makes LaTeX a tightly integrated component of your editing workflow by visualizing selected source chunks (such as single formulas or graphics) directly as images in the source buffer.

This is a rebuild of 11.87-1 due to a change in the TeX Live directory structure as of TeX Live 2013.
