+ldesc: "AUCTeX is an extensible package for writing and formatting TeX
+files in GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  It supports many different TeX macro
+packages, including AMS-TeX, LaTeX, Texinfo, ConTeXt, and DocTeX (dtx
+files).  AUCTeX includes preview-latex which makes LaTeX a tightly
+integrated component of your editing workflow by visualizing selected
+source chunks (such as single formulas or graphics) directly as images
+in the source buffer."
